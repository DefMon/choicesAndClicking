I have been silent for a while. Schedules are hard, who knew? Anyway, in an effort to keep myself posting here I'm going to start posting about a progress I'm making on a project I'm working on. I whole heartedly expect this to lead to at least a few posts which are of no interest to anyone, but with any luck some of them will be good.

This project is a little game, in the same vein as <a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A Dark Room</a>. I started it as a way to teach myself <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>. This worked pretty well as a way to learn the framework, but I never really finished it. I didn't follow any sort of process with it, building something new whenver a new idea occured. This made the whole thing a bit of a mess and meant I never really finished it.

This week I decided to start again, but this time use <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angularjs</a>. I've recently moved jobs to an office which uses angular so it seemed prudent to actually learn how to use it. I'm going to use posting here as a way to try and keep myself disciplined in my approach.

So. Week 0. https://www.facebook.com/groups/469547203077958/

I started off with <a href="http://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate/#/home">Angular Boilerplate</a>. This is a project which you can build on top of. It helps you out by starting with a great suite of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> plugins set up, defining a sensible project structure, and including <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter bootstrap</a>. Basically, it gives you all sorts of cool stuff that would be boring to set up when you just want to start writing some code. 

I added <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="https://github.com/agrublev/angularLocalStorage">AngularLocalStorage</a> to the vendor folder of the project. One thing which tripped me up at first was that while Angular Boilerplate does a lot of things for you, you need to add vendor files to the build.config file for grunt to find them and put them into your page.

I'm probably going to switch out underscore for <a href="http://lodash.com/">lodash</a> at some point, but I've used underscore for now. Either way, I've previously talked about why <a href="http://watsonbs.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/utilitying-with-underscore-js/">they are awesome</a>.

The final bit of set up I did was switch out the browser used by Karma so that it used <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">Phantomjs</a>.

Next week I'll talk more about what I'm aiming for with this game, what I regard as the core functionality, and how I've implemented it
