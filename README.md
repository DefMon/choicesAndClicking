choicesAndClicking is a small game engine built on Backbone.

Inside prototype is my initial pass where I worked out what I regarded as its core requirements and how Backbone works. But the code in there is pretty rank because of that. The rest of the files are the current version.

It only works when run on a server, server.js is a node server you can use to achive that. Install node, check out, navigate to the choicesAndClicking folder in the command line and run node server.js

Then in Chrome (Currently untested in any other browser) go to localhost:3000/game.html. Right now it's underwhelming.

Alternatively, go to localhost:3000/prototype/game.html to see what direction it is headed in.

To change (Or indeed, add) game content, modify the files under Objects.
